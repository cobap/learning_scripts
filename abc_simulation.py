# How it works?

# Food source = Problem Solutions
# Employed bees = Agents - Go from food source to food source (Random, but always keep next to food sources)
# Onlooker bees = Agents - Learn from employed bees Roulette Wheel Selection Algorithm
# Scout bees = Choose their food sources randomly to replace abandoned food sources that cannot be improved any further after # trails

# %%

# We generate initial location for each bee in the space
